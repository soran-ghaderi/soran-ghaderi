<h1>Soran Ghaderi</h1>
<p>Computer science graduate with over three years of experience in developing deep learning and machine learning pipelines.</p>
<p>Aims to make contributions to a dynamic team researching computer vision and/or NLP with a profound interest in 
using attention mechanisms in cognitive computing, particularly machine vision.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I've been developing and maintaining python libraries (i.e.
<a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/Emgraph">Emgraph</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/Bigraph">Bigraph</a>) as well as a few other standalone projects.

<h4>Major Projects</h4>
<ul>
<li><h5>Emgraph</h5><p>A python library for developing, training, and evaluating knowledge graph representation 
learning. It also comes with a small model zoo, which is primarily used for benchmarking and comparing new models.</p></li>
<li><h5>Bigraph</h5><p>If you are working with n-partite graphs, you are familiar with its intricacies when it comes to 
applying normal graphs' algorithms; that's where Bigraph comes into play and provides 
researchers with an easy-to-use API. It also computes algorithms on GPU if you have
CUDA and graphic drivers installed.</p></li>
<li><h5>TASE</h5><p>A lightning-fast audio full-text search engine on top of Telegram It allows users to quickly and 
easily find information that is of genuine interest or value, without the need to wade through numerous irrelevant 
channels. It provides users with search results that lead to relevant information on high-quality audio files.</p></li>
